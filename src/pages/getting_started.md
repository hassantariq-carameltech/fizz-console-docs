# Getting Started

## Getting started with server integration

### Create unique user IDs
Skip this step if you have internal unique user IDs for your user base.

Fizz requires a unique ID for each user. It is recommended that you have an API which generates unique IDs for your users. Fizz server will not be called in this instance.

### Get user token
You can get a unique user token against each ID that is generated in first step. Please refer to [Authentication and Initialization](authentication_and_initialization) for details.

## Getting started on Unity
You will need to start with creating a Fizz application ID for your application. The application ID will be used to configure your Fizz SDK within Unity.

### Create your application on Fizz
In order to create your application on Fizz, you have to contact Fizz management.

#### Add SDK to your Unity project

* Step 1: Create a new project in Unity Editor.

<i>FIZZUISDK</i> instance can be null if itâ€™s not present in the scene, so you have to check that whenever you are launching Fizz UI. For launching Fizz UI you can use the following piece of code.

<pre class="prettyprint unity">
if (FIZZUISDK.Instance != null)
	FIZZUISDK.Instance.LaunchFizz ();
</pre>
