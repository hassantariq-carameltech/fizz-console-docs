## What is Fizz ?

Fizz is a full-stack hosted platform for in-game chat and instant message system. This documentation will help developers easily integrate Fizz into their gameâ€™s code.

Once integrated, users will be able to:

- Send messages in the game (global, clan/guild, etc.) 
- Auto-Translate messages in ${LANGUAGES} languages 
- Send custom game messages with deeplinks
  
Fizz chat platform does not impose a feature set on the game. Game developers are free to opt the set of features based on their game design needs. This allows Fizz to be incrementally integrated into the game, i.e. developers can perform a basic integration and plan the remaining features for future releases.
